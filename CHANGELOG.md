# Changelog

All notable changes to the AEC BIM Platform. Releases are signed, auto-updating desktop builds
(Windows / macOS / Linux); the updater always serves the latest. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## v0.1.37 — COBie field depth (C2) + investment-deck market/timeline slides
- **COBie model-derived field enrichment (C2)** — the handover sheets gain the fields FM teams use:
  Space net/gross **area** + usable height (from Qto), Type **manufacturer / model / warranty /
  expected-life / replacement-cost / color / material**, Component **serial / install-date /
  warranty-start / tag / asset-id**, plus a new **Attribute** sheet that flattens every remaining
  property set (Name/Value/SheetName/RowName) so nothing is lost in handover.
- **Investment deck — Market & Timeline slides** — the pitch deck grows from 4 to 6 slides: a
  **Market & positioning** slide plotting the deal's yield/IRR/soft-cost against conceptual benchmark
  bands, and a **Development timeline** gantt bar (predev → construction → lease-up → stabilization →
  exit, durations from the saved scenario), plus a **site photo** on the cover from project attachments.

## v0.1.36 — printable statutory lien-waiver documents
- **Lien-waiver documents / PDFs** — pay-app accounting, lien-waiver *record tracking* and COBie
  enrichment already shipped earlier; this adds the piece they lacked: the actual **printable
  statutory waiver form**. `cost.lien_waiver` renders the four conditional/unconditional ×
  progress/final forms (Cal. Civ. Code §8132–8138 style) from a pay application — notice, body and
  amount (current payment due for progress, contract sum to date for final) — exposed as
  `GET /projects/{id}/cost/lien-waiver` (JSON) and `.pdf`, plus a "⚖ Lien waiver / release" action in
  the viewer cost panel. Complements the existing `POST /cost/lien-waiver` record-tracking endpoint.

## v0.1.35 — Test Fit depth (egress · parking · polygon footprint · proforma)
- **Deeper egress / life-safety check (A2)** — `test_fit.egress` now screens the big four IBC fails:
  max travel distance, **occupant load** & required **egress width**, minimum **number of exits**, and
  **exit separation** (½ diagonal / ⅓ sprinklered) — with per-check detail + flags (e.g. an assembly
  hall trips ≥4 exits). Back-compatible with the prior keys.
- **Parking as real IFC geometry** — `generate(..., parking=N)` lays out a surface lot of `N`
  IfcSpace `PARKING` stalls (2.5×5 m + drive aisles) on a dedicated *Site Parking* storey, each with
  area QTOs. Exposed on the generate API + a "Surface parking stalls" field in the proforma form.
- **True polygon-offset footprint** — for `lot_polygon` parcels the buildable footprint is now a real
  inward setback (`offset_polygon`, handles reflex vertices + over-collapse), surfaced as
  `buildable_polygon`, instead of a bounding-box approximation.
- **Optimize tied to the proforma** — the generative sweep's yield-on-cost + new **development
  spread** (bps vs exit cap) come from the canonical `proforma.returns` functions (with stabilized
  occupancy), so the quick screen matches the full underwriting; you can rank by `dev_spread_bps`.

## v0.1.34 — import external IFC families (M3) + visual node editor (M4 complete)
- **Import IFC type content** — bring manufacturer / 3rd-party families into a project from any IFC:
  `families.import_types_from_ifc` copies every IfcTypeProduct (with geometry) in via
  `project.append_asset` (deduped, idempotent), then they're placeable like the built-in catalog.
  New endpoint `POST /projects/{id}/families/import` + *"⇪ Import IFC families…"* in the authoring
  panel. Completes M3.
- **Studio — visual computational graph (M4)** — a new **Studio** workspace renders the Dynamo/
  Hypar-style compute engine as a node editor: drag node types from a palette, wire output→input
  ports (click-to-connect, SVG bezier edges), edit params inline, and **Run** to execute the graph
  server-side in dependency order with values flowing through the wires (zoning → cost → yield, etc.).
  Graph persists locally; shown for developer/architect/engineer personas. Completes M4 — the whole
  **M-theme (M1–M4) is now done**.

## v0.1.33 — material layer sets + family library (M3)
- **Layered construction assemblies** — generated models now carry real **IfcMaterialLayerSet**
  data on walls, slabs and roofs (e.g. exterior wall = brick · cavity · insulation · CMU · gypsum),
  the way Revit's compound structures work — attached via IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage and chosen from
  `IsExternal` / slab type. Feeds take-off, U-value and schedules.
- **Expanded parametric family library** — the placeable catalog grows from 16 to 37 entries across
  new **Lighting**, **MEP** (AHU, fan-coil, diffuser, electrical panel), **Structural** (steel
  column/beam) and **Transport** categories, plus more furniture/sanitary/appliances. Families are
  now **parametric**: pass `dims` to place a distinctly-named, correctly-sized **type variant**
  (Revit-style type families). New element classes get palette colours too.

## v0.1.32 — first-person walkthrough (M2 complete)
- **Walkthrough mode** (🚶 toolbar) — Matterport-style first-person navigation: drops to eye height
  (1.6 m), **W/A/S/D** to walk (locked horizontal so you stay on the floor) and drag to look around.
  Switches to a perspective view on enter and restores your prior camera on exit. Completes M2.

## v0.1.31 — sun & shadow study (M2)
- **Sun / shadow study** (☀ toolbar) — drive the render-mode sun by **date, time-of-day and
  latitude/longitude** with a live panel; shadows track the real solar arc (NOAA solar-position
  math), with warm low-angle light and a below-horizon night state. Opening it auto-enables render
  mode. Pure solar math is unit-tested.

## v0.1.30 — PBR materials + free Revit import
- **PBR pass (M2)** — render mode now upgrades plain lit surfaces to `MeshStandardMaterial`
  (roughness/metalness, keeps the M1 IFC colours) lit by an **IBL studio environment** for soft
  ambient + reflections, on top of the sun/shadows. Reversible; Fragments' own shader meshes are
  left untouched so the engine renderer is never at risk.
- **Free Revit → IFC path** — the Open menu now has *"Free: export IFC from Revit (no bridge)…"*:
  a guide to Revit's built-in IFC export + the free, open-source **pyRevit**, so getting a model in
  doesn't require the paid Autodesk bridge.
- **Docs** — library interoperability evaluation (roadmap §L: IFClite, pyRevit, FreeCAD, Pascal
  Editor) and ADR 0001 on dependency bundling & the signed-update policy (deps are pinned and ship
  inside the app update — never background-updated independently).

## v0.1.29 — render mode (M2 start)
- **Viewer render mode** (◓ toolbar) — a directional **sun with soft (PCF) shadows**, hemisphere
  sky/ground fill + fill light, **ACES tone mapping** and sRGB output, and a shadow-catching ground
  plane. Off by default (flat shading stays the cheap default); re-applies as new models load.
  First step toward Revit/Rhino/Matterport-style rendering.

## v0.1.28 — faster large-model loading
- **Download progress** — large models stream with a live "downloading N% (x/y MB) → preparing
  geometry" label instead of a generic spinner that looked frozen.
- **ETag revalidation** — `model.frag` now serves an ETag + `must-revalidate`: unchanged models
  re-open instantly via **304**, while a republished/edited model is always refetched (fixes a
  stale-cache bug where an immutable 1-year cache served the old geometry forever).

## v0.1.27 — computational graph (M4 start)
- **Dynamo-style node graph** over the pure engines: `GET /compute/nodes` (palette) and
  `POST /compute/graph` run a {nodes, edges} graph in dependency order (zoning → structure / takt /
  cost → yield-on-cost). Zero-touch: function params become input ports, dict returns become outputs.

## v0.1.26 — IFC materials & surface colours (M1 start)
- **Materials & surface styles** — generated/dome models get an IfcMaterial + IfcSurfaceStyle colour
  per element class (concrete, glazing, steel, vegetation…), so models carry real material data.

## v0.1.25 — gamified getting-started
- **Getting-started checklist** — a floating progress pill guides new users through the 6 core
  actions (load a model, generate, test-fit, budget, project, memo) with a progress bar + celebration.

## v0.1.22 — 4D & the vertical assembly line
- **4D construction sequencing** — map model elements onto a takt plan; **scrub the build sequence
  in the viewer** (a slider isolates what's built to date).
- **Takt / line-of-balance chart** (SVG) and an **egress check** (two means + travel distance).

## v0.1.21 — lean & multi-period billing
- **Lean / Last-Planner PPC** — a weekly-plan module + Plan-Percent-Complete analytics with reasons
  for non-completion.
- **Multi-period pay apps** — roll completed-to-date across successive draws; retainage release on
  the final application.

## v0.1.20 — underwriting realism (II)
- **Capital reserves above NOI**, **citable guardrail bands** (sourced from the benchmarks), and
  **Test Fit optimize seeded from the live project** (real land + cost budget).

## v0.1.19 — built-world techniques (Willis · Salvadori · CM/RE research)
- **Takt / line-of-balance** scheduling with a just-in-time delivery plan (R2).
- **Lean PPC** engine (R4) and citable **benchmarks + a comparables module** (R5).

## v0.1.18 — structural-system advisor (R3)
- Pick a plausible system by height/span (flat-plate · shear-core · outrigger) with rough member
  sizing + a load-path read — driving the generated frame (after Salvadori).

## v0.1.17 — form follows finance (R1)
- Generative massing / Test Fit reward **daylight-limited rentable depth** + core efficiency — the
  highest rentable yield wins, not max FAR (after Carol Willis).

## v0.1.16 — underwriting realism (I) + Finance revamp
- **Risk-adjusted** specialty/operating revenue + **guardrails** that flag returns outside market
  bands. Finance reorganized into sub-tabs with a sticky live-returns bar.

## v0.1.15 — pitch deck
- One-click **pitch-deck PDF** variant of the investment memo (B6).

## v0.1.14 — generative optimize + real parcels
- **Generative design** sweeps unit-mix × parking and ranks by yield-on-cost (A5); **real lot
  polygons** drive the program by shoelace area (A6).

## v0.1.13 — Test Fit + property/tax
- **Test Fit** — corridor unit-mix layout, parking solver, scheme compare (A1/A3/A4); **property &
  tax assumptions** feeding OPEX (B3).

## v0.1.11 — specialty assets
- On-site **energy** (solar/wind/battery/rainwater) and **vertical-farm (PFAL)** revenue flow into
  capex / revenue / opex (B4).

## v0.1.10 — developer cost portal
- Line-item **hard/soft cost budgets** (B1), **Sources & Uses** (B2), and a one-click **investment
  memo PDF** (B5).

## v0.1.6–0.1.8 — accounts, AI & hardening
- **SSO** (Google / Microsoft / Procore) + a no-admin free-tier model; first-run **onboarding + tour**.
- **"Ask AI"** project assistant over a live snapshot; AI risk summaries + drafted RFIs.
- **Field capture** (offline photo → punchlist/observation, syncs on reconnect).
- Production hardening — rate limiting, security headers, auth-secret fail-safe, takeoff caching.
- Full generative lifecycle from zoning (frame + units + envelope + core).

## v0.1.0–0.1.5 — foundation
- **BIM viewer** (Three.js + Fragments, offline WASM), federation, clash, IDS, 2D drawings/sheets,
  in-viewer authoring round-trip.
- **GC portal** — config-driven modules (RFIs, submittals, change-order chain, daily, QA, safety…),
  CPM, pay apps, dashboards.
- **Development proforma** — S&U with interest-reserve circularity, XIRR/NPV/EM, JV waterfall,
  sensitivity + Monte Carlo.
- **Generative massing + family library**; free single-project **desktop app** with signed,
  auto-updating releases.
