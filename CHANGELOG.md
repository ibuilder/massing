# Changelog

All notable changes to the AEC BIM Platform. Releases are signed, auto-updating desktop builds
(Windows / macOS / Linux); the updater always serves the latest. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## Unreleased — multi-format reference models + QR share
- **Open meshes & point clouds** — alongside IFC/Fragments, the viewer now opens **OBJ, STL, PLY,
  glTF/GLB** meshes and **PCD, XYZ, LAS, LAZ** point clouds as **view-only reference overlays** (IFC
  stays the source of truth). LAS/LAZ are decoded locally (offline) via a vendored `laz-perf` WASM;
  big clouds are decimated to stay responsive. Reference models list in the federation panel with
  visibility + remove. **Open ▾ → Open mesh / point cloud…**
- **QR share** — a toolbar **📱 Share via QR** shows a scannable deep link to open the project on a
  phone/tablet.
- **Faster Open IFC** — the native file dialog now appears instantly (the heavy 3D module warms in
  parallel); large IFCs (>~60 MB) route through the server pipeline and stream optimized fragments
  instead of parsing the whole file in-browser.
- **Live demo shows the full platform** — the GitHub Pages viewer-only build now bundles a read-only
  sample project so the GC portal, Budget/GMP, Schedule and Finance panels render with real data.

## v0.1.80 — multi-user persona views + optional paid RVT→IFC bridge
- **Membership shapes the view** — a project member's party role (GC / Owner / Consultant /
  Subcontractor) now auto-selects their persona on open, so they land in the right workspace set;
  capability role already gated edit controls. Members modal (add / role / party / remove) present.
- **Revit (.rvt) → IFC bridge (optional, paid)** — feature-flagged on `APS_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`, doubly
  gated: bridge off → 501 + the free IFC-export path; on → must `confirm_cost` (Autodesk bills per
  conversion). Real RVT→IFC runs Revit's exporter via APS Design Automation (`APS_DA_ACTIVITY`).

## v0.1.79 — 4D colour scrub + quantity takeoff by floor
- **Time-aware 4D scrub** — scrubbing the timeline paints the model green floor-by-floor (rest
  ghosted) with a live **cost-burn** readout from the cost-loaded cash-flow curve.
- **QTO by floor & discipline** — quantities + cost mapped to the storey they sit on, per-floor
  totals + a discipline (IFC class) roll-up.

## v0.1.77–78 — 5D element intelligence
- **Click an element → its 5D** — schedule activity (%-complete, dates, hard-tied vs by-trade) +
  cost-code budget vs committed vs actual. **Model heatmap** — colour by %-complete or cost variance.
- **One-click generate seeds the GC portal** — lot→building→deal also creates cost codes, a
  hard-cost-allocated budget, a GMP prime contract, and a cost-loaded schedule.

## v0.1.73–76 — dashboards + investor deliverables, one language
- **Developer Overview command center** + cross-pillar **Portfolio** (GC status *and* developer
  returns per project, blended IRR), one-click **Save scenario**, and a **Construction Status**
  section in the investor memo + deck. **PX executive band** — on-schedule next to on-budget.

## v0.1.67–72 — developer ↔ GC capital chain
- **GMP ↔ hard-cost reconciliation + one-click sync**, construction **draws** from the schedule, an
  **actuals loop** (owner invoices → re-forecast IRR), **construction-loan draws** (equity-first)
  with **interest accrual** + **per-cost-code composition**, and a **lender draw-request PDF**.

## v0.1.60–66 — GMP project budget (its own destination)
- **Budget** is a first-class destination: the agreed GMP broken to every cost code & bid package +
  General Conditions / Requirements (incl. **staffing** projections) + overhead / fee / contingency,
  each budget vs committed vs actual vs **EAC/ETC**. **Buyout savings**, **change orders → revised
  GMP**, owner **SOV from the budget**, a **cash-flow S-curve**, **baseline + variance** — reconciled
  to the developer proforma's hard cost.

## v0.1.53–59 — relational schedule, field/mobile, GC module depth
- **Relational scheduling** — `schedule_activity` drives the Gantt / Line-of-Balance / CPM **and**
  the 3D 4D model; editable P6 `.xer` import; **lookahead** + **milestone** schedules.
- **Field/mobile** — bulk photo + camera capture, photo-first records, offline upload queue;
  **coordination-issue BCF round-trip**.
- **GC module depth** — ball-in-court, super/PM personas, fieldsets, researched Tier-1/2/3 field sets
  across the 73 modules. **Release pipeline hardened** (version from git tag; single-draft publish).

## v0.1.52 — GC dashboard redesigned as a command center
- **Dashboard rebuilt around the new nav rail** — the redundant "All modules" catalog is gone (the
  persistent left rail owns navigation now), and the dashboard is a focused command center: **clickable
  KPI cards** that jump straight to the relevant filtered module (Open RFIs → RFIs · open), a risk
  summary, a prominent **"Ball in your court"** action list (with a caught-up empty state), a grouped
  **Project health** card (budget over/under + safety + lean PPC), trend charts, and Ask AI at the
  bottom — in a two-column layout that stacks on narrow screens.

## v0.1.51 — cost-code workflow: inline add + wider links (roadmap D1 + X1)
- **Inline "add new" from reference dropdowns (D1)** — every reference field (cost code, location, sub…)
  now has a "＋ Add new …" option that creates the record without leaving the form and selects it. So
  while coding a budget line you add the cost code on the spot. Falls back to the target module's
  required field, so a new Cost Code is created with its `code`.
- **Cost-code links on cost-impacting modules (X1)** — RFIs, CORs, change events, PCO requests and
  proposals gained a `cost_code` reference, so impacts tag a code and roll up to the budget (joining
  budget/commitment/direct-cost/timesheet). `/modules` now exposes `title_field`/`ref_prefix`.

## v0.1.50 — GC portal navigation rail + module improvement roadmap
- **Persistent left nav rail in the GC portal** — opening a module used to replace the whole panel, so
  moving between the 73 modules meant going "back" every time. Now a sticky left rail (Dashboard +
  filter + favorites + collapsible sections) stays visible and loads each module into a content pane —
  jump anywhere in one click, with the active module highlighted. (Stacks above the content on phones.)
- **GC module deep-dive roadmap** ([docs/gc-modules-roadmap.md](docs/gc-modules-roadmap.md)) — a
  field-by-field audit of all 73 modules benchmarked against Procore/Fieldwire + how Turner/Suffolk/
  Balfour run these workflows, with cross-cutting themes (cost-code links everywhere, ball-in-court
  /assignee, fieldsets, inline add-from-dropdown, super-vs-PM views, cross-module conversions) and
  tiered per-module priorities. How to **add cost codes**: Construction → Cost Codes (Resources) → + Add.

## v0.1.49 — left rail revamp (crisp icons + expandable labels)
- **Modernized the left icon rail** — the oldest piece of the UI. The cryptic `⌗`/`≣` Unicode glyphs
  are replaced with crisp inline **SVG icons** (hierarchy / layers / flag / gear), and the rail is now
  **expandable** (VS Code activity-bar style): a `‹`/`›` toggle widens it 46→150 px to show **Tree /
  Layers / Issues / Tools** labels beside each icon, persisted to localStorage. Structure unchanged
  (the four Model-workspace panels were already the right set); this is legibility + feel.

## v0.1.48 — closeout package reachable in the UI
- **Full turnover .zip now has UI access** — the `closeout/package.zip` deliverable (as-built IFC +
  COBie/QTO/space workbooks + status report + closeout records) worked via the API but had **no
  button anywhere**. Added it to **Save ▾ → Closeout package (.zip)** and the **Tools → Exports**
  panel (📦). Found by debugging every menu item against a real demo project. (The `.mmproj` bundle —
  geometry + full database + blobs, round-trips via Open/Save — was already wired.)

## v0.1.47 — end-to-end demo hardening (closeout filename + generate→finance)
Two real bugs found by a full login→closeout demo run (only surface with a realistic project):
- **Closeout package 500** on any project name containing a non-latin-1 char (em-dash, smart quote,
  accent, emoji): the name went into a `Content-Disposition` header, which HTTP encodes as latin-1 →
  crash. Fixed with a shared `safe_filename()` (also hardens the `.mmproj` bundle vs CJK/emoji).
- **Finance showed $0 right after generating a model**: generate didn't persist a cost budget, so
  Sources & Uses read the empty starter. Generate now seeds a `dev_budget` (land + hard from GFA×$/sf
  + soft) → Finance immediately shows the real deal ($21.2M uses on the demo).
Regression-locked: the closeout test now uses an em-dash project name; the generate test asserts
non-zero Sources & Uses. Full gate green (API 30/30).

## v0.1.46 — Studio UX hardening
- **Studio layout bug fixed** — `#panel-studio` carries both `.fullpanel` and `.studio`, and
  `.fullpanel.active{display:block}` was overriding `.studio{display:flex}`, so the node canvas grew
  to its full 1700 px content instead of filling the viewport. Now a higher-specificity rule forces
  the flex column; the canvas is viewport-bounded and **scrolls internally**.
- **Touch support** — node dragging uses pointer events (+ `setPointerCapture`, `touch-action:none`),
  so it works on tablets/phones, not just mouse.
- **Empty-state guidance** — an in-viewport hint ("add a node… then wire… Run", or "connect the API")
  when the canvas is empty.
- **Smarter node placement** — new nodes drop into the current scroll viewport (with a small cascade)
  instead of a fixed corner that overlapped after a few adds.

## v0.1.45 — custom unit-mix editor (A1b — Test Fit A-theme complete)
- **Define your own unit mix** — the Test Fit panel gains an editor to add/remove unit types
  (name · target SF · mix %), saved to localStorage. "Compare schemes" sends it with `with_defaults`
  so your mix is **ranked against the built-in presets**. Completes A1b — the Test Fit A-theme
  (A1–A6 + egress check + auto egress geometry) is now fully done.

## v0.1.44 — P6 .xer → 4D dates + auto code-positioned egress (A2)
- **Primavera P6 schedule → 4D dates** — `POST /projects/{id}/schedule/import-xer` parses a P6 `.xer`
  (TASK table) and stores it; the **4D scrub then reports real calendar dates** (`source:"p6"`, the
  project's start→finish window) instead of relative takt days. New "⬆ Import P6 schedule (.xer)"
  button beside the 4D tool; a 📅 line shows the imported range. `DELETE …/import-xer` reverts to takt.
  (Element build-order stays takt-derived — no per-activity element mapping is claimed.)
- **A2 — auto code-positioned egress geometry** — generated models with a service core now place
  **two means of egress**: the core stair plus a second "Egress stair 2" at the opposite corner
  (≥⅓-diagonal remoteness, IBC 1007.1.1). Completes the generative half of Test Fit A2 (the egress
  pass/fail check already existed).

## v0.1.43 — demo-aware empty states, mobile/PWA polish, P6 .xer import
- **Demo-aware empty states** — the GC portal & drawings no longer show a misleading "pick a project"
  in the viewer-only Pages demo (there's no backend there). A shared `noProjectHtml` explains it's the
  viewer demo + links to the full app; in the real app it gives an actionable "create/open a project"
  hint.
- **Mobile / PWA polish** — `touch-action:none` + `overscroll-behavior:none` on the 3D container so
  camera-controls own touch gestures (orbit/pan/pinch) instead of the page scrolling; PWA install meta
  (theme-color, apple-mobile-web-app-*, viewport-fit=cover); bigger tap targets for the rail + viewer
  tools on phones.
- **Primavera P6 .xer schedule import** — `schedule.parse_xer` reads the TASK table (planned→actual→
  early date fallback) into the activity rows the CSV mapping path consumes, so a P6 schedule can drive
  the 4D scrub. `.mpp` stays export-to-XML/CSV (proprietary binary). Gated in test_analysis.
- **Roadmap reconciled** — A-theme status clarified (A1/A3/A4/A5/A6 + egress check + parking geometry
  + polygon offset done; only unit-type presets + auto-placed egress geometry remain); schedule-import
  + "what else to import" + Revit/Navisworks-plugin + IFC5-alpha verdicts recorded.

## v0.1.42 — main.ts refactor round 2 (account/admin UI) + login on modalShell
- **Modularization** — the account / auth / admin surface (sign-in + SSO, reset, account menu,
  self-service password, admin user management, audit log, project-member management; ~330 lines)
  moves out of `main.ts` into `account/accountUI.ts` behind a small deps object. With round 1's
  connections extraction, **`main.ts` drops from 1205 → 657 lines**.
- **Login fix** — the sign-in dialog hand-rolled its own overlay and so lacked Esc-to-close, a focus
  trap and dialog ARIA. It's now built on the shared `modalShell` like every other modal — consistent
  look + behaviour + accessibility.

## v0.1.41 — main.ts modularization (round 1) + XSS hardening
- **Security (stored-XSS fixes)** — admin modals interpolated user/remote values straight into
  `innerHTML`. Now escaped via a shared `escapeHtml`: connection **name/type**, Procore **project ID**
  + sync info, **browsed DB** column names & cell values, and audit-log fields (the audit modal's
  weaker local escaper is replaced). No user- or database-controlled string renders as HTML anymore.
- **Modularization + perf** — the ~240-line admin **Data-connections UI** (list/add, Procore
  schedules + field-mapping, SQL browser) moved out of `main.ts` into `connections/connectionsUI.ts`,
  **lazily imported** so its ~13 kB leaves the initial bundle and loads only when an admin opens it.
  `main.ts` drops from ~1205 to 963 lines. Behavior unchanged; verified via the vite transform
  pipeline + typecheck + web unit tests.

## v0.1.40 — viewer camera fix + egress surfaced (UX verification pass)
- **Fix: NaN camera / broken 3D view** — loading a model while the Model workspace wasn't visible
  (e.g. a reload that restored the Finance/Drawings workspace, or opening a model from another
  workspace) created the viewer in a 0×0 container, making `camera.aspect` = 0/0 = NaN; the subsequent
  `fitToSphere` baked NaN into the camera position and the viewport showed nothing once you switched
  to Model. Now the fit is **deferred while the viewport is hidden** and run once it has real
  dimensions, the aspect is forced valid synchronously (OBC's ResizeObserver is async), and a
  hard camera reset recovers an already-NaN camera that `setLookAt` alone can't clear.
- **Egress / life-safety now reachable** — the deepened A2 check (occupant load, travel distance,
  required exits, exit separation) was computed but had no UI. `test-fit/compare` now returns the
  plate-level egress result and the Test Fit panel shows a ✅/⚠️ life-safety line with the figures and
  any code flags.
- Found during a full hands-on verification of everything built this session (viewer tools, Studio
  node editor, generate+parking, families/import, deck, lien waivers, COBie, dashboard, 4D) — all
  others confirmed working end-to-end.

## v0.1.39 — accessibility pass (tab semantics, labels, live region)
- **a11y** — the workspace switcher and finance sub-tabs now carry `role="tablist"`/`role="tab"` with
  `aria-selected` kept in sync as you switch (screen readers announce the active view); the role/persona
  picker gained an `aria-label`; and the status bar is a polite `role="status"` live region so status
  updates are announced. Builds on the existing landmarks (`main`/`nav`/`header`/`footer`), `lang`, and
  icon-button `aria-label`s.

## v0.1.38 — Redis rate limiting (multi-worker) + dashboard perf
- **Distributed rate limiter** — set `AEC_REDIS_URL` and the per-IP request limit is now shared across
  workers/processes via an atomic Redis `INCR`+`EXPIRE` (fixed 60s window), so the limit holds under a
  multi-worker deployment instead of being per-process. Fail-open: any Redis error falls back to the
  in-process bucket so limiter infrastructure can never take the API down; redis is imported lazily
  only when the URL is set (no new dependency for the single-worker/desktop build). New `test_ratelimit`
  gate covers the enforcement path (health/metrics exempt, 429 + Retry-After past the limit).
- **Dashboard perf** — the GC dashboard no longer loads and JSON-parses every record across all
  modules. Status tallies now come from a single indexed `GROUP BY workflow_state` per module (zero
  JSON), and the `data` blob is parsed only for the **active** (non-terminal) records that feed
  overdue + action-items — so completed-record-heavy projects build the dashboard far faster. Output
  is byte-for-byte identical (`test_dashboard` unchanged).

## v0.1.37 — COBie field depth (C2) + investment-deck market/timeline slides
- **COBie model-derived field enrichment (C2)** — the handover sheets gain the fields FM teams use:
  Space net/gross **area** + usable height (from Qto), Type **manufacturer / model / warranty /
  expected-life / replacement-cost / color / material**, Component **serial / install-date /
  warranty-start / tag / asset-id**, plus a new **Attribute** sheet that flattens every remaining
  property set (Name/Value/SheetName/RowName) so nothing is lost in handover.
- **Investment deck — Market & Timeline slides** — the pitch deck grows from 4 to 6 slides: a
  **Market & positioning** slide plotting the deal's yield/IRR/soft-cost against conceptual benchmark
  bands, and a **Development timeline** gantt bar (predev → construction → lease-up → stabilization →
  exit, durations from the saved scenario), plus a **site photo** on the cover from project attachments.

## v0.1.36 — printable statutory lien-waiver documents
- **Lien-waiver documents / PDFs** — pay-app accounting, lien-waiver *record tracking* and COBie
  enrichment already shipped earlier; this adds the piece they lacked: the actual **printable
  statutory waiver form**. `cost.lien_waiver` renders the four conditional/unconditional ×
  progress/final forms (Cal. Civ. Code §8132–8138 style) from a pay application — notice, body and
  amount (current payment due for progress, contract sum to date for final) — exposed as
  `GET /projects/{id}/cost/lien-waiver` (JSON) and `.pdf`, plus a "⚖ Lien waiver / release" action in
  the viewer cost panel. Complements the existing `POST /cost/lien-waiver` record-tracking endpoint.

## v0.1.35 — Test Fit depth (egress · parking · polygon footprint · proforma)
- **Deeper egress / life-safety check (A2)** — `test_fit.egress` now screens the big four IBC fails:
  max travel distance, **occupant load** & required **egress width**, minimum **number of exits**, and
  **exit separation** (½ diagonal / ⅓ sprinklered) — with per-check detail + flags (e.g. an assembly
  hall trips ≥4 exits). Back-compatible with the prior keys.
- **Parking as real IFC geometry** — `generate(..., parking=N)` lays out a surface lot of `N`
  IfcSpace `PARKING` stalls (2.5×5 m + drive aisles) on a dedicated *Site Parking* storey, each with
  area QTOs. Exposed on the generate API + a "Surface parking stalls" field in the proforma form.
- **True polygon-offset footprint** — for `lot_polygon` parcels the buildable footprint is now a real
  inward setback (`offset_polygon`, handles reflex vertices + over-collapse), surfaced as
  `buildable_polygon`, instead of a bounding-box approximation.
- **Optimize tied to the proforma** — the generative sweep's yield-on-cost + new **development
  spread** (bps vs exit cap) come from the canonical `proforma.returns` functions (with stabilized
  occupancy), so the quick screen matches the full underwriting; you can rank by `dev_spread_bps`.

## v0.1.34 — import external IFC families (M3) + visual node editor (M4 complete)
- **Import IFC type content** — bring manufacturer / 3rd-party families into a project from any IFC:
  `families.import_types_from_ifc` copies every IfcTypeProduct (with geometry) in via
  `project.append_asset` (deduped, idempotent), then they're placeable like the built-in catalog.
  New endpoint `POST /projects/{id}/families/import` + *"⇪ Import IFC families…"* in the authoring
  panel. Completes M3.
- **Studio — visual computational graph (M4)** — a new **Studio** workspace renders the Dynamo/
  Hypar-style compute engine as a node editor: drag node types from a palette, wire output→input
  ports (click-to-connect, SVG bezier edges), edit params inline, and **Run** to execute the graph
  server-side in dependency order with values flowing through the wires (zoning → cost → yield, etc.).
  Graph persists locally; shown for developer/architect/engineer personas. Completes M4 — the whole
  **M-theme (M1–M4) is now done**.

## v0.1.33 — material layer sets + family library (M3)
- **Layered construction assemblies** — generated models now carry real **IfcMaterialLayerSet**
  data on walls, slabs and roofs (e.g. exterior wall = brick · cavity · insulation · CMU · gypsum),
  the way Revit's compound structures work — attached via IfcMaterialLayerSetUsage and chosen from
  `IsExternal` / slab type. Feeds take-off, U-value and schedules.
- **Expanded parametric family library** — the placeable catalog grows from 16 to 37 entries across
  new **Lighting**, **MEP** (AHU, fan-coil, diffuser, electrical panel), **Structural** (steel
  column/beam) and **Transport** categories, plus more furniture/sanitary/appliances. Families are
  now **parametric**: pass `dims` to place a distinctly-named, correctly-sized **type variant**
  (Revit-style type families). New element classes get palette colours too.

## v0.1.32 — first-person walkthrough (M2 complete)
- **Walkthrough mode** (🚶 toolbar) — Matterport-style first-person navigation: drops to eye height
  (1.6 m), **W/A/S/D** to walk (locked horizontal so you stay on the floor) and drag to look around.
  Switches to a perspective view on enter and restores your prior camera on exit. Completes M2.

## v0.1.31 — sun & shadow study (M2)
- **Sun / shadow study** (☀ toolbar) — drive the render-mode sun by **date, time-of-day and
  latitude/longitude** with a live panel; shadows track the real solar arc (NOAA solar-position
  math), with warm low-angle light and a below-horizon night state. Opening it auto-enables render
  mode. Pure solar math is unit-tested.

## v0.1.30 — PBR materials + free Revit import
- **PBR pass (M2)** — render mode now upgrades plain lit surfaces to `MeshStandardMaterial`
  (roughness/metalness, keeps the M1 IFC colours) lit by an **IBL studio environment** for soft
  ambient + reflections, on top of the sun/shadows. Reversible; Fragments' own shader meshes are
  left untouched so the engine renderer is never at risk.
- **Free Revit → IFC path** — the Open menu now has *"Free: export IFC from Revit (no bridge)…"*:
  a guide to Revit's built-in IFC export + the free, open-source **pyRevit**, so getting a model in
  doesn't require the paid Autodesk bridge.
- **Docs** — library interoperability evaluation (roadmap §L: IFClite, pyRevit, FreeCAD, Pascal
  Editor) and ADR 0001 on dependency bundling & the signed-update policy (deps are pinned and ship
  inside the app update — never background-updated independently).

## v0.1.29 — render mode (M2 start)
- **Viewer render mode** (◓ toolbar) — a directional **sun with soft (PCF) shadows**, hemisphere
  sky/ground fill + fill light, **ACES tone mapping** and sRGB output, and a shadow-catching ground
  plane. Off by default (flat shading stays the cheap default); re-applies as new models load.
  First step toward Revit/Rhino/Matterport-style rendering.

## v0.1.28 — faster large-model loading
- **Download progress** — large models stream with a live "downloading N% (x/y MB) → preparing
  geometry" label instead of a generic spinner that looked frozen.
- **ETag revalidation** — `model.frag` now serves an ETag + `must-revalidate`: unchanged models
  re-open instantly via **304**, while a republished/edited model is always refetched (fixes a
  stale-cache bug where an immutable 1-year cache served the old geometry forever).

## v0.1.27 — computational graph (M4 start)
- **Dynamo-style node graph** over the pure engines: `GET /compute/nodes` (palette) and
  `POST /compute/graph` run a {nodes, edges} graph in dependency order (zoning → structure / takt /
  cost → yield-on-cost). Zero-touch: function params become input ports, dict returns become outputs.

## v0.1.26 — IFC materials & surface colours (M1 start)
- **Materials & surface styles** — generated/dome models get an IfcMaterial + IfcSurfaceStyle colour
  per element class (concrete, glazing, steel, vegetation…), so models carry real material data.

## v0.1.25 — gamified getting-started
- **Getting-started checklist** — a floating progress pill guides new users through the 6 core
  actions (load a model, generate, test-fit, budget, project, memo) with a progress bar + celebration.

## v0.1.22 — 4D & the vertical assembly line
- **4D construction sequencing** — map model elements onto a takt plan; **scrub the build sequence
  in the viewer** (a slider isolates what's built to date).
- **Takt / line-of-balance chart** (SVG) and an **egress check** (two means + travel distance).

## v0.1.21 — lean & multi-period billing
- **Lean / Last-Planner PPC** — a weekly-plan module + Plan-Percent-Complete analytics with reasons
  for non-completion.
- **Multi-period pay apps** — roll completed-to-date across successive draws; retainage release on
  the final application.

## v0.1.20 — underwriting realism (II)
- **Capital reserves above NOI**, **citable guardrail bands** (sourced from the benchmarks), and
  **Test Fit optimize seeded from the live project** (real land + cost budget).

## v0.1.19 — built-world techniques (Willis · Salvadori · CM/RE research)
- **Takt / line-of-balance** scheduling with a just-in-time delivery plan (R2).
- **Lean PPC** engine (R4) and citable **benchmarks + a comparables module** (R5).

## v0.1.18 — structural-system advisor (R3)
- Pick a plausible system by height/span (flat-plate · shear-core · outrigger) with rough member
  sizing + a load-path read — driving the generated frame (after Salvadori).

## v0.1.17 — form follows finance (R1)
- Generative massing / Test Fit reward **daylight-limited rentable depth** + core efficiency — the
  highest rentable yield wins, not max FAR (after Carol Willis).

## v0.1.16 — underwriting realism (I) + Finance revamp
- **Risk-adjusted** specialty/operating revenue + **guardrails** that flag returns outside market
  bands. Finance reorganized into sub-tabs with a sticky live-returns bar.

## v0.1.15 — pitch deck
- One-click **pitch-deck PDF** variant of the investment memo (B6).

## v0.1.14 — generative optimize + real parcels
- **Generative design** sweeps unit-mix × parking and ranks by yield-on-cost (A5); **real lot
  polygons** drive the program by shoelace area (A6).

## v0.1.13 — Test Fit + property/tax
- **Test Fit** — corridor unit-mix layout, parking solver, scheme compare (A1/A3/A4); **property &
  tax assumptions** feeding OPEX (B3).

## v0.1.11 — specialty assets
- On-site **energy** (solar/wind/battery/rainwater) and **vertical-farm (PFAL)** revenue flow into
  capex / revenue / opex (B4).

## v0.1.10 — developer cost portal
- Line-item **hard/soft cost budgets** (B1), **Sources & Uses** (B2), and a one-click **investment
  memo PDF** (B5).

## v0.1.6–0.1.8 — accounts, AI & hardening
- **SSO** (Google / Microsoft / Procore) + a no-admin free-tier model; first-run **onboarding + tour**.
- **"Ask AI"** project assistant over a live snapshot; AI risk summaries + drafted RFIs.
- **Field capture** (offline photo → punchlist/observation, syncs on reconnect).
- Production hardening — rate limiting, security headers, auth-secret fail-safe, takeoff caching.
- Full generative lifecycle from zoning (frame + units + envelope + core).

## v0.1.0–0.1.5 — foundation
- **BIM viewer** (Three.js + Fragments, offline WASM), federation, clash, IDS, 2D drawings/sheets,
  in-viewer authoring round-trip.
- **GC portal** — config-driven modules (RFIs, submittals, change-order chain, daily, QA, safety…),
  CPM, pay apps, dashboards.
- **Development proforma** — S&U with interest-reserve circularity, XIRR/NPV/EM, JV waterfall,
  sensitivity + Monte Carlo.
- **Generative massing + family library**; free single-project **desktop app** with signed,
  auto-updating releases.
